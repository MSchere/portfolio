## About me
*Check my CV <a href="cv/Europass_EN.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>*

I'm a **cypherpunk computer engineer** passionate about **blockchain** and **web development**. My drive is to create **innovative solutions** that contribute to a rapidly and ever-evolving digital landscape.

The dynamic nature of blockchain technology keeps me on my toes, constantly **learning** and **adapting**. This aligns perfectly with my love for **continuous growth** and discovery.

Beyond the world of code, I enjoy pumping iron at the gym, losing myself in a good book, exploring virtual worlds in video games and cherishing moments with family and friends.

My journey in tech has taken me through both **decentralized systems** and **traditional finance**, giving me a unique perspective on the potential for innovation in how we interact with **money** and **data**.

At my core, I'm driven by the transformative power of **disruptive technologies** and I'm excited to be part of a movement that's reshaping how we engage with the digital world, each other, and the concept of value itself.
