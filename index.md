## About me
*Check my CV <a href="cv/Europass_EN.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>*

I’m a **cypherpunk computer engineer** passionate about **blockchain** and web **development**. I’m building amazing solutions that try to improve this fast changing world.

Being a full-stack blockchain developer requires me to be a **continuous learner** as the space moves much quicker than my knowledge about it. However, I find learning as one of the biggest pleasures in my life along with going to the gym, reading, playing videogames, raving and spending time with family and friends.

I also have experience developing traditional finance systems for wholesale banking and data reconciliation scripts.

I love working with new and **disruptive technologies** that have the power to change how we interact with money, things and people.
